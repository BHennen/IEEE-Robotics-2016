All the libraries that our sketches will use will go here. They are used for each subsystem of the robot,
or similar things that go together.

format: Libraries\LibraryName\Examples\SketchFolder(s)

The LibraryName folder contains the .h file, .cpp file and examples folder for the library.
The Examples folder has arduino sketch folders.
In each sketch folder is the .ino sketch file that can independently test the functions of the library.
